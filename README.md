## Abstract
This research involves navigating cloud environments in an attempt to understand what makes a poorly secured cloud environment particularly susceptible to cyber-attacks. We live in an era where web spaces are becoming essential to our well-being as electricity was in the early 20th century. The difference, however, is that attacks on power stations and grids were not nearly as prevalent as they are with cloud computing. The objective of this project is to address major issues surrounding cloud computing infrastructure and services. It aims to understand and analyze current programming standards and security measures in an attempt to discover potential problems and find solutions.

## What I Learned
Through this research, I gained significant insights into cloud security practices, cryptographic protocols, and vulnerabilities in cloud environments. Key takeaways include:

1. **Cryptographic Protocols and TLS Security**:
   - Deepened understanding of TLS protocols and their components such as RSA and AES.
   - Explored critical concepts like forward secrecy, session resumption mechanisms (0-RTT and 1-RTT), and their roles in secure communication.

2. **Common Vulnerabilities in Cloud Systems**:
   - Identified vulnerabilities like SQL injection, weak authentication mechanisms, and improper access control that compromise cloud environments.
   - Evaluated security risks associated with third-party TLS implementations and the challenges of widespread adoption of advanced features like 0-RTT.

3. **Best Practices in Secure Cloud Programming**:
   - Emphasized the importance of secure coding, access control, and robust cryptographic standards to mitigate risks in cloud systems.
   - Proposed actionable strategies to improve cloud security, including the integration of forward secrecy and strengthening key exchange mechanisms.

4. **Broader Impact of Cloud Security**:
   - Recognized the critical role of secure cloud infrastructure in protecting data privacy and maintaining operational integrity.
   - Developed a research-based perspective on addressing systemic weaknesses in cloud security frameworks to prevent potential cyber-attacks.
